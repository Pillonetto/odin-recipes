        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p> I love being able to make fried rice at home, and this recipe is as easy as you could ask for!</p>

        <h3> Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of Jasmine Rice</li>
            <li>2 cups of Chicken Stock</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>2 large, beaten eggs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of sesame seeds</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon of black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place rice, chicken stock, and water in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until tender and liquid has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat, stir in 2 tablespoons butter, and let cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add eggs and scramble, stirring often to chop chunks of egg into small bits with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Place rice in a large mixing bowl, add eggs, and toss together.</li>
            <li>Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Dump rice mixture into the hot pan. Add sesame seeds, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring often, for 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Taste and add more butter or soy sauce as desired. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
